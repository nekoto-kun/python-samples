## About `samples` directory

The `samples` directory is used for storing resources that are used in the examples. The resources are referenced in the examples using relative paths. I have provided them with `samples.7z` file and you can extract it using 7-Zip or any other archive manager.

Please note that there are some files that are not included in the `samples` directory due to privacy concerns. You can create your own files or use the examples with your own files.
